/**
 * Solution to the TicTacToe game with MiniMax algorithm with Alphaâ€“beta pruning.
 * The task was not as easy as I thought. I did some research and then implemented 
 * this rather "heavy" solution. I tried to keep it as much OOP-oriented, as possible.
 * There are quite a lot "magic" number, but this time I decided not to  handle them
 * as constants to keep the code simpler for me. There is an option if the player wants
 * to be first or second. As far as I tested, the bot cannot be defeated and the program
 * works fast enough.
