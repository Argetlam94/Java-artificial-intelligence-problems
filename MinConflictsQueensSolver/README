/**
 * Solution to the N-queens puzzle with MinConflict algorithm.
 * The program works for puzzles that are significantly large as requested in
 * the task. I have tried to implement quite a lot optimization, so that we can
 * have good execution times for big input. For example, if we want to solve a 
 * board with size 5000 x 5000 it will take between 190 and 280 seconds. I've tested
 * it for 10k x 10k board and it takes about half an hour. The key in my optimization
 * is using only one dimensional arrays - not even ArrayLists so that we can skip the
 * unwanted AutoBoxing and AutoUnboxing.
