/**
 * Solution to the Max-cost-Backpack problem with Genetic algorithm.
 * This task was very difficult for me. I tried to implement the pseudo code given
 * on the exercise as close as possible. A population is represented with ArrayList
 * of individuals, which are stored as arrays of integers. This is not optimal but
 * is easy to work with. Because there are so many random driven changes, the solution
 * is not always the best, but in more iterations the program should find the best
 * solution a couple of times.
