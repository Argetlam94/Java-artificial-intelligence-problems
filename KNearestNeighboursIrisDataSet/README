/**
 * A variant of the ÐºNearestNeighbours algorithm for the Iris Data Set.
 * I was not presented on the exercise where this algorithm was explained, 
 * but after some discussions with colleagues that were there, I think I got the idea.
 * This task is definitely not OOP-structured, but that is on purpose. I think that
 * this solution is better, because it is direct and that makes it far easier - no need
 * of implementing middle-layer access methods. However, I tried to make it as generalized
 * as I could. If we want to change the data set, we just need to change the values of
 * some constants, as long as its the same type. The solution is not optimal, because
 * there will be quite a lot of auto-boxing, but ArrayList was cleaner to use in this case.
